/* Best case: O(n^2) - The best case is O(n^2) since it always does the same number of comparisons and swaps regardless of the initial order of elements. */
/* Average case: O(n^2) - The average case involves the same number of comparisons and swaps for each element. */
/* Worst case: O(n^2) - The worst case occurs when the array is in reverse order, leading to maximum comparisons and swaps. */
